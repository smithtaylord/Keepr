# Keepr - A Social Network for Collectors
Keepr is a social network that allows users to visually share and discover new interests by posting images or videos to their own, or others', collections (i.e., a collection of 'vaults,' usually with a common theme) and browsing what other users have kept.

This application is built using a full-stack approach, with Vue.js and Vue-Router for the frontend, DotNet WebApi for the server-side implementation, and MySQL for the database. This project also utilizes Auth0 for user management and Dapper as an ORM.

### Features
